"""Language model training script.

This module sketches out the structure of a function that would fine‑tune
a small language model on a dataset of text.  It is not fully
implemented.  In practice you would load a pre‑trained model (e.g.
``distilbert-base-uncased`` or ``gpt2``) from HuggingFace, prepare your
dataset and then call the ``Trainer`` API.

    ----------
    dataset_dir : pathlib.Path
        Path to the directory containing the training data (e.g. JSON

    output_dir : pathlib.Path
        Directory where the fine‑tuned model and checkpoints will be
