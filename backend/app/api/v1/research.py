"""API for deep research queries.

This endpoint performs a multiâ€‘step research process: it uses the
browsing agent to search for relevant information, then summarises
the results using the summariser agent.  The response returns a
consolidated answer and references.  This feature demonstrates how
agents can be orchestrated to provide richer answers than simple
search or summarisation alone.
