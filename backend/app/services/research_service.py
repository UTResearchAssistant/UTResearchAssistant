"""Research service for deep research queries.

This module coordinates multiple agents to perform complex queries.
Given a research question, it first calls a browsing agent to obtain
highâ€‘level results and then uses a summariser agent to produce a
concise answer.  The implementation uses stub agents defined in
``agents/`` and can be expanded later to include citations and
context retrieval from the vector database.
